    <h2 class="heading">About Me</h2>
    <p>Hello! I'm Ryan and I currently reside in sunny San Diego, California. I moved down here in the summer of 2021, but I was born and raised in San Jose, California.
      I spent my entire life there and decided it was time for a change of scenery! So I packed up my belongings, along with my dog Gus, and have been enjoying life as a
      San Diegan ever since.
    </p>
    <p>When I'm not coding, my main hobbies include watching and playing sports such as volleyball and basketball, and playing video games such as Valorant. By day, I am
      a volleyball coach, helping youth explore the incredible sport that has brought me so much joy and opportunities throughout my life! While it has been an incredible
      experience thus far, I am so excited for this next chapter in my life. Though my coding journey has just begun, I ultimately hope to combine my passions and code within
      the realm of sports!
